# Testing policy: verified interpreter, text format, differential backend tests

Status: draft spec, not implemented.

## 1. Summary

The backends are tested independently of any frontend. A test is a small program written in a
text format, plus input cases. A **verified interpreter** is the ground truth. Every backend
compiles the program, runs it out of process on the same cases, and must match the interpreter
**exactly**, with NaN as the only exception: any NaN equals any NaN.

New pieces:

- `tungsten-parse`: a lenient parser from text to `OptimizedProgram` and a canonical printer
  back to text.
- `tungsten-checker`: the core IR, the (unverified) lowering from `OptimizedProgram` to it, and a
  **Verus-verified** well-formedness and type checker.
- `tungsten-interpreter`: a **Verus-verified** interpreter over the core IR. The executable
  interpreter is proven to refine a spec semantics written as `spec fn`s.
- `tungsten-testsuite` (`publish = false`): the harness, the test corpus, the extern registry,
  the prelude, and minimal test runtimes for Rust, Java and CUDA.

## 2. Decisions

| Topic | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| Verification tool | Verus. The crates build with plain `cargo` (`verus!{}` erases). Proofs run with `scripts/verify.sh` (pinned Verus), locally only. They don't gate CI. |
| What is proven | Spec + refinement: exec interpreter == spec semantics. Plus type soundness of the checker, fuel monotonicity, and the layout lemma (§6.3). Floats are uninterpreted in both spec and exec. |
| Verified IR | A lowered **core IR** (dense `Vec` indices, resolved types, no names). The lowering from `OptimizedProgram` is ordinary Rust and is tested, not proven. |
| Checker | Verified. `check(p) == Ok` ⇒ the interpreter never gets stuck. |
| Termination | Fuel. `OutOfFuel` is a distinct outcome and fails the test. Recursion is rejected by the checker (call graph is a DAG). |
| Edge semantics | Java semantics, normative for every backend: wrapping integer arithmetic, masked shift amounts, saturating float→int casts with NaN→0. Integer `/` and `%` by zero is an error. |
| Short-circuit | `And`/`Or` are lazy. Everything else is evaluated left to right, and the first error wins. |
| Typing | Strict: operands must have identical types, with one exception: `Vec3 ∘ Pos3` / `Pos3 ∘ Vec3` for `+ - * /`. |
| Float comparison | Bit-exact for every backend, including `-0.0` vs `0.0`. NaN is a class: payloads are unspecified and unobservable. CUDA builds with strict IEEE flags (§9.3). |
| Transcendentals | Not primitives. Written as IR helper functions in a prelude, so every backend compiles the same `+ - * /`. |
| min/max | Java `Math.min`/`max`: NaN propagates, and `-0.0 < 0.0`. |
| Bitcasts | Only canonicalizing `float_to_bits` (Java `floatToIntBits`, all NaN → canonical) and `bits_to_float`. |
| Externs | A test-owned registry with one implementation per target. Tests can only use registered externs. Extern types are registry-declared records. |
| Permutation tables / samplers | A toy deterministic builder from the registry, identical in all targets. Real noise correctness stays with tungsten-mc. |
| Evaluation model | Pointwise lazy with memoization, independent of `Interface` scheduling. Explicit indices are decoded through the spec'd layout. Out-of-bounds is an error. |
| Ambient variables | IR change: `Expression::Ambient(AmbientKind)` replaces the four `Named` default variables. |
| Scale keys | Merging two scales through fixed-point collision is a bug. There's a regression test for it, marked `@knownfail` until fixed. |
| Text format | Lenient parser, canonical printer. `parse(print(m)) ≅ m` over compacted arenas, and `print ∘ parse` is a fixpoint on printed text. Not a bijection: comments and whitespace are free. |
| Float literals | Shortest round-trip decimal with type suffix, `inf`/`-inf`, and `nan(0x…)` with explicit bits. |
| Test file | Program + `@case` + optional `@expect` + `@knownfail`. Without `@expect`, the interpreter is the oracle. |
| Known failures | `@knownfail(backend, "reason")` in the test file. A knownfail that passes is an error. |
| Execution | Out-of-process driver per backend, one build per batch, binary bit protocol. Java and CUDA are skipped with a notice when the toolchain is missing. |
| Grid sizes | Small (≤ 4×4×4) by default. `@tier(large)` runs only with `TW_LARGE=1`. |
| Test levels | Hand-written corpus, differential, optimizer equivalence, random well-typed programs, lowering and round-trip. Interface property tests are out of scope (except the scale-key regression). |
| CI gate | Rust + Java execution of the default tier. CUDA and Verus run locally only. |

Dependencies: `tungsten-interpreter → tungsten-checker → tungsten-ir`, and
`tungsten-parse → tungsten-ir`. The testsuite depends on all of them and on every backend.
Verus crates (`vstd`, `builtin`, `builtin_macros`) come in as `[workspace.dependencies]`, pinned
to one Verus release.

## 4. Required changes outside the new crates

1. **`Expression::Ambient(AmbientKind)`** in `tungsten-ir`, with `AmbientKind = Origin | Pos3 |
   OriginScale | PositionScale`. It carries no `Ref`, so `retag.rs` is unaffected. Remove
   `declare_default_parameters` from legacy conversion and emit `Ambient` reads instead. Every
   backend and inspect lowers `Ambient` to `config.origin`, `p.pos`, and so on. Ambients are
   read-only.
2. **`compact()` and structural equality** in `tungsten-ir` (`compact`, `isomorphic` and
   `permute` are in `rebuild.rs`, next to `retag.rs`, and reuse its walker).
   `compact` removes holes and resets generations (it renumbers refs). Structural equality
   (`isomorphic`) ignores tags, compares arenas in iteration order, and compares floats by bit
   pattern.
   The derived `PartialEq` on `Expression` makes `Float(NaN) != Float(NaN)`, so it can't be used
   for this.
3. **`derive_binop_type`** (shared by rust/java) matches §5.3: shifts and bitwise ops become
   derivable, and `I32 ∘ Bool` is dropped.
4. **Backend conformance** with §5 (wrapping ops, shift masks, cast helpers, Java min/max,
   short-circuit). This is tracked through `@knownfail` and isn't a prerequisite for the suite.
5. **`Interface` scale keying** on exact `f64` bits. Tracked by the scale-key regression.

## 5. Semantics (normative)

### 5.1 Values

`Bool`, `I8`, `I32`, `I64`, `F32`, `F64`, `Vec3 {x,y,z: f64}`, `Pos3 {x,y,z: i32}`,
`Array(T, n)`, `Record(name, fields)` for registry extern types, `PermTable(handle)` and
`Sampler(handle)`. `DensityInput` never appears as a value; it only exists as a read
(§6). `UnaryOperator::Ref(_)` is the identity on values.

### 5.2 Outcomes

`eval : Program × Case × Fuel → Ok(values per entry cell) | Err(e)` with
`e ∈ { DivByZero, OutOfBounds, OutOfFuel, ExternDomain }`. `Stuck` exists in the spec but is
unreachable for checker-accepted programs (§7). Evaluation is left to right: call arguments,
binary operands (except `And`/`Or`), construct and array-literal elements. The first error in
that order is the result.

### 5.3 Typing (checker)

- Arithmetic `+ - * /`: identical numeric operand types, or the `Vec3`/`Pos3` exception. In the
  exception, each `Pos3` component is converted i32→f64 exactly and the op is applied to each
  component in f64. The result is `Vec3`.
- `%` isn't in the IR. Comparisons need identical scalar types. `Equal`/`NotEqual` aren't defined
  on `Vec3`/`Pos3`/arrays/records.
- `And`/`Or`: `Bool` only. `BitAnd`/`BitOr`/`BitXor`: identical integer or `Bool` types.
- Shifts: left operand integer, right operand `I32`.
- `Not`: logical on `Bool`, bitwise complement on integers. `Negate`: numeric types.
- `ExplicitCast`: between all numeric types, `Bool → integer` (0/1), `Pos3 → Vec3`. No other
  casts.
- `Construct`/`ConstructExtern`: `ConstructExtern` needs an `Extern` type whose registry fields
  it lists. The parser accepts any type there (and repeated `parameters`), so these are checker
  errors.
- Grids: every `dimensions` component of an entry point or density input is at least 1. The
  parser accepts any `i32`.
- Statements: every variable is definitely assigned before it's read, every path returns,
  `Break` only appears inside `While`/`Repeat`, the call graph is acyclic, constants are acyclic,
  and every extern and extern type is in the registry with matching signature.

### 5.4 Integer and float operations (Java)

- `+ - *` wrap modulo 2^width. `/` truncates toward zero. `MIN / -1 = MIN`. `/ 0` is
  `DivByZero`.
- Shift amount is masked to `width-1` (31 for i32, 63 for i64). `>>` is arithmetic and
  `LogicalShiftRight` is logical.
- `I8` operations: sign-extend to i32, apply the i32 rule, truncate to i8. This is exactly Java's
  `byte` promotion, including `>>>` on negative bytes.
- Float→int: round toward zero, saturate at bounds, NaN→0. Int→float and f64→f32 round to
  nearest even. Integer narrowing truncates.
- Floats follow IEEE-754 binary32/binary64, with each operation rounded to its own type and no
  contraction into FMA. Comparisons follow IEEE, so NaN compares false except with `!=`.
- `fma` exists only as an explicit registry extern.

### 5.5 Statements

`Repeat { count }` runs the body `count` times. `Break` leaves the innermost `While`/`Repeat`.
`Return` leaves the function. Each `While` iteration and each `Repeat` iteration costs one unit
of fuel.

## 6. Entry and density-input evaluation

### 6.1 Grid and positions

An evaluation context is `Config { origin: Vec3, origin_scale: Vec3, position_scale: Vec3,
dimensions: (i32,i32,i32) }` plus a cell `c ∈ [0,dx)×[0,dy)×[0,dz)`. `Ambient(Pos3)` is `c` (the
local grid coordinate), and the other ambients are the `Config` fields. World positions are
computed by the program itself (`origin*origin_scale + pos3*position_scale`), not by the
interpreter.

An entry point is evaluated for every cell of its `dimensions`, with `origin` from the `@case`
and the scales from the entry. A `DensityInput d` is evaluated with the same `origin` and
`d.scaled_origin`, `d.scaled_position`, `d.dimensions`.

### 6.2 Layout

`flat(c, dims) = c.x + c.y*dx + c.z*dx*dy`, with x varying fastest. This matches `as_index` and
`Iter3D` in tungsten-mc. `decode(i, dims)` is its inverse on `[0, dx*dy*dz)`.

### 6.3 Reads

- `DensityVariable(d, None)`: if `d.dimensions == (1,1,1)`, read cell `(0,0,0)` of `d`.
  Otherwise, take the caller's flat index `flat(c, caller_dims)` and read cell
  `decode(i, d.dimensions)` of `d`. This mirrors `buffers.d[index(it)]`. An index outside `d`'s
  grid is `OutOfBounds`.
- `DensityVariable(d, Some(e))`: `e` evaluates to an integer index. A negative index or one
  ≥ `len(d)` is `OutOfBounds`. Otherwise, read cell `decode(e, d.dimensions)`.
- Reads are memoized on `(unit, config bits, cell)`. Memoization is an exec-only optimisation,
  and it's proven equal to the unmemoized spec.

Lemma (verified): `decode(flat(c, dims), dims) == c` for every `c` in range, and
`flat(decode(i, dims), dims) == i`.

## 7. Verification

### 7.1 Structure

- `spec fn eval_*` define the semantics over the core IR with explicit fuel.
- Exec `fn eval_*` have `ensures result == spec_eval_*(…)`. The memo table invariant is
  `∀ k ∈ memo. memo[k] == spec_eval_cell(k)`.
- `check` has `ensures result.is_ok() ⇒ well_typed(p)`.

### 7.2 Theorems

1. **Refinement**: exec interpreter == spec, for every fuel.
2. **Type soundness**: `well_typed(p)` ⇒ spec evaluation never returns `Stuck`, and every `Ok`
   value has its declared type.
3. **Fuel monotonicity**: if fuel `f` gives a result other than `OutOfFuel`, every `f' ≥ f`
   gives the same result.
4. **Layout**: §6.3 lemma.

### 7.3 Trusted base

Verus itself. The primitive layer `prim.rs`: every float operation and registry extern is an
`external_body` fn whose `ensures` equates it to an uninterpreted `spec fn`. The lowering, the
parser, the harness and the runtimes are all tested, not proven. Kani harnesses for the lowering
and for cast/shift edge cases are possible later work.

## 8. Text format

The full format (grammar, elaboration, printer, envelope) is specified in
`crates/tungsten-parse/SPEC.md`, which supersedes the syntax below where they differ.

### 8.1 Properties

- `parse` is lenient: free whitespace, `//` comments, and derivable fields may be omitted (extern
  parameter and return types come from the registry, `Field` types from the base type,
  `source_hash` defaults to 0).
- `print` is canonical and fully explicit: 4-space indent, fully parenthesized binary ops,
  explicit types everywhere.
- Required: `parse(print(m)) ≅ compact(m)`, and `print(parse(print(m))) == print(m)`.
- Variable names: `Named(s)` prints as `s`, `Prefixed(s)` as `s#N`, and `Anonymous` as `%N`,
  where `N` is the compacted slot index.
- Floats: shortest round-trip decimal with a mandatory `.` (`1.5f`, `-0.0`, `2.0`), `inf`,
  `-inf`, `inf_f32`, and NaNs with their full bits: `nan_f32(0x7fc00000)` /
  `nan(0x7ff8000000000000)`. Integers: `1b`, `1`, `1L`.
- Required only within the nesting limit (256 levels of expressions, blocks, types and values;
  SPEC §6.2). Deeper programs print, but the text doesn't load.

### 8.2 Test file

```text
// Description and comments are free text.
@knownfail(cuda, "f2i cast is UB in device code")

program {
    host scale: f64;
    table t0 = perlin("minecraft:offset", none, 0);
    const half = 0.5;

    fn lerp(a: f64, b: f64, t: f64) -> f64 {
        return (a + (t * (b - a)));
    }

    fn base_main() -> f64 @hosts(scale) {
        let x: f64 = ((ambient(pos3) as vec3).x * host(scale));
        return lerp(x, half, 0.25);
    }

    unit base {
        main base_main;
        tables [t0];
        hosts [scale];
        helpers [lerp];
        consts [half];
    }

    fn top_main() -> f64 {
        return (density(b) * 2.0);
    }

    unit top {
        main top_main;
        input b = base @dims(4, 1, 4) @origin_scale(1.0, 1.0, 1.0) @position_scale(4.0, 1.0, 4.0);
    }

    entry top @dims(4, 1, 4) @origin_scale(1.0, 1.0, 1.0) @position_scale(4.0, 1.0, 4.0);
}

@case "origin" origin(0, 0, 0) seed(1) host(scale = 2.0)
@case "far"    origin(1000000, -64, 3) seed(1) host(scale = -0.0)
@expect "origin" top[0, 0, 0] = 0.25
@expect "far" error(OutOfBounds)
```

Every fn is top level and a unit names its main fn (`main f;`). Lists (`helpers`, `tables`,
`hosts`, `consts`) are explicit and never derived. Simple statements and items end in `;`.

Other directives: `@fuel(n)`, `@tier(large)`, and `@cells(sample = n, seed = s)` to compare only
a sample of cells on large grids.

## 9. Harness

### 9.1 Flow per test file

1. `load(src, file, env)` (the testsuite supplies the registry and the prelude as the `Env`), then check the round-trip (§8.1).
2. Lower and check. A rejected program is a test failure, unless the file says
   `@expect reject`.
3. Interpret every case. If `@expect` is present, the interpreter must match it (this tests the
   ground truth itself).
4. For each backend: `compile`, then run the driver and compare (§9.4).
5. Run `perform_inline`. The interpreter result on the inlined program must equal step 3, and
   the backends rerun on the inlined program.
6. Reconcile with `@knownfail`: an expected failure that passes is an error.

### 9.2 Drivers

Generated code, the test runtime, and a generated driver per test (each test in its own
module/package) go into `target/tw-cache/<backend>/<hash>/`. They build once per batch with
`cargo` / `javac` / `nvcc`, and the build is cached by content hash. Protocol: little-endian
binary on stdin and stdout. Cases go in as origin (3×f64), seed (u64), and host inputs as raw bits
in declaration order. Results come back per entry, per cell, as raw bits, or as an error tag and
kind. A watchdog timeout counts as a hang (the `OutOfFuel` counterpart).

### 9.3 Backend build flags

- Rust: release profile with `overflow-checks = true`, so a non-wrapping op in generated code
  panics and shows up as a mismatch. A panic maps to an error.
- Java 21: FP is strict by default. `ArithmeticException` maps to `DivByZero` and
  `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` to `OutOfBounds`.
- CUDA: `-fmad=false -prec-div=true -prec-sqrt=true -ftz=false`, no `--use_fast_math`. Cases
  whose interpreter result is an error aren't compared on CUDA, since it can't trap reliably.

### 9.4 Comparison

Values must be equal bit-for-bit, and any two NaNs are equal. For errors, Rust and Java must
also produce an error, and the kind is compared when the driver can map it. The interpreter
records every `If`/`While` decision per cell. On a mismatch, the report shows the first
diverging decision (re-running a backend trace mode when one is available), the cell, and both
values in hex and decimal.

## 10. Registry and prelude

- **Primitive externs** (implemented in `prim.rs` and every runtime): `sqrt`, `floor`, `ceil`,
  `trunc`, `abs`, `min`, `max` (Java), `copysign`, `fma`, `float_to_bits` (canonical),
  `bits_to_float`, `perm_get(PermTable, i32) -> i32`, `sampler_sample(Sampler, Vec3) -> f64`
  (toy, integer-hash based, exact). Each one is declared in `registry.toml` with its signature
  and any domain error (`ExternDomain`).
- **Toy builders**: a table is `splitmix64(hash(ident, subident, index) ^ seed)`-derived, and
  the spec is in `registry.toml`. Each language has an identical implementation.
- **Extern types**: declared records with typed fields. `ConstructExtern`/`Field` work on them
  structurally.
- **Prelude** (`prelude.tw`): `sin`, `cos`, `exp`, `log`, `pow`, `lerp`, `smoothstep`,
  `as_index`, `corner*` helpers, all written with basic operations. A test pulls them in with
  `use prelude::{sin, lerp}`, which adds them as helper functions.

## 11. Test levels

| Level | What | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| L0 | Unit tests of the parser, checker, interpreter and lowering | each crate |
| L1 | Round-trip (§8.1) over the corpus and generated programs | `tests/roundtrip.rs` |
| L2 | Lowering: snapshot of the core IR for the corpus, plus invariants (types and arity preserved, every ref resolved). A lowering bug also shows up indirectly as a differential mismatch | `tests/lowering.rs` |
| L3 | Interpreter vs `@expect` (hand-computed) | `tests/corpus.rs` |
| L4 | Interpreter vs each backend | `tests/corpus.rs` |
| L5 | Optimizer equivalence (§9.1 step 5) | `tests/corpus.rs` |
| L6 | Random well-typed programs (proptest, shrinking). Failures are written to `corpus/regressions/`. A fixed seed and a small count run in the normal suite; `TW_FUZZ=<n>` runs longer locally | `tests/random.rs` |

Required corpus coverage, at least one file each: every operator × every type, overflow and
shift masks, every cast edge case (NaN, ±inf, out-of-range), `-0.0`, short-circuit with an
erroring right side, break/return inside nested loops, `Repeat 0`, constants that reference
constants, density inputs at `(1,1,1)` / equal / different dims, explicit-index corner reads at
the grid edge (OOB), and the scale-key collision.

## 12. CI

GitHub Actions with JDK 21: `cargo test --workspace` runs L0–L6 on Rust and Java. CUDA tests are
skipped with a notice. Verus: `scripts/verify.sh`, run locally only.

## 13. Open items

- Confirm in tungsten-mc that every density input of an entry gets the entry's `origin`
  (§6.1), and that `Vec3` is f64 in the runtime the Rust backend targets (`mathf64.rs`) rather
  than f32 (`math.rs`).
- Decide whether Verus crates are taken from a git revision or from crates.io, and pin the
  version in `scripts/verify.sh`.
- Error-kind mapping for Rust panics (needs identifiable panic messages from the generated
  code), or compare only error vs non-error.
